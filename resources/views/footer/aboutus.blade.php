                    <p class="card-text">If you're looking for hundreds more restructuring questions - or want a more fulsome
                        understanding of what restructuring really is in practice - be sure to check out the Restructuring
                        Interviews course.

                        I created the Restructuring Interviews course because I recognized just how unprepared most
                        candidates are when they interview and I just love writing about restructuring.

                        Creating the course has been a fun side project and I've loved getting to meet those who sign up.
                        I'm always happy to answer their questions and see them get into restructuring.

                        While most interview guides are absurdly expensive - costing hundreds of dollars - I don't charge
                        anything close to that. The course really aims to appeal to not just those interviewing for a
                        restructuring job, but also those who are just curious about what restructuring investment banking
                        is, what the deliverables look like, etc. .</p>
